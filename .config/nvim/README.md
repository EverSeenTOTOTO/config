# neovim lua config

This is my personal neovim lua config, forked from [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad), [lvim](https://github.com/abzcoding/lvim#customization), [Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) and [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim).

Recommend to use [neovide](https://neovide.dev/index.html) as neovim client.
